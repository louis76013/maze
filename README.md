### The executable
Download the file maze.exe. While doing so a warning from the browser may appear, just select keep rather than discard. When trying to run the file, it might take some time for the computer to scan the file.
### The project
1. the main logic is implemented in standard C++ which is portable for Linux
2. there are a few APIs designed for button click function calls
3. the UI is done by Borland C++ Builder, because it's cleaner and easier, and the key point is that it support standard C++, as versus  Visual family
